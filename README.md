# Rebalancing a 2-Asset Portfolio: T-Bills and S&P 500

This project simulates and analyzes a simple portfolio rebalancing strategy involving two asset classes:
- **T-Bills** (risk-free asset)
- **S&P 500 Index** (risky asset)

We aim to maintain a constant 30% / 70% allocation between T-Bills and the S&P 500, and compare portfolio performance under different rebalancing strategies.

---

## Project Goals

- Implement a basic 2-asset portfolio with a 70/30 S&P/T-Bill allocation
- Simulate portfolio evolution with:
  - No rebalancing (buy and hold)
  - Time-based rebalancing (monthly, quarterly)
  - Threshold-based rebalancing
- Analyze key performance metrics: returns, volatility, drawdowns, Sharpe ratio
- Visualize portfolio behavior over time

---

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- yfinance (for historical data)
- (Optional) pandas-datareader / FRED API
